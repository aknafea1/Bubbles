### What I learned

This was my first time using the <canvas> tag in a project, and honestly, it was a game-changer. It answered so many of the questions I’d always had about how those epic animations are made. Now I see it clearly—canvas is where it all begins.

While working on this, I also gained a much better understanding of JavaScript classes, especially the use of the this keyword. I explored several 2D context methods like arc(), which I used in a simple animation. What amazed me was how straightforward it was to animate using canvas—just by updating coordinates and clearing the previous frame. Achieving a similar effect with the DOM would require many more steps, like dynamically creating and removing elements from the DOM tree—definitely more complex and less efficient.

So why am I writing this? Because I stumbled upon <canvas> while trying to learn how to animate characters using JavaScript. Back then, I was using setInterval, and it quickly turned into a mess—repetitive code and chaotic logic everywhere.

Then I came across a video titled "Coding Snake in 4 Minutes and 30 Seconds." The title alone caught my attention. The creator was using the canvas tag, and even better—he offered a free course on making classic games like Tennis (you know, the old-school paddle and ball game). That’s when everything clicked. Canvas wasn’t just a tag—it was a portal to interactive, high-performance graphics.
